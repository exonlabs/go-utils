This utility package for converting between big-endian byte slices and various
numeric types such as `uint64`, `uint32`, `uint16`, `uint8`, and their signed
counterparts. It provides efficient and simple functions to handle big-endian
encoding/decoding of numbers and supports conversion both from and to byte slices.

Features:

- Convert between byte slices and `uint64`, `uint32`, `uint16`, and `uint8`.
- Handle signed integers with conversion functions for `int64`, `int32`, `int16`, and `int8`.
- Support conversion from integers to big-endian byte slices.
- Optimized for performance with minimal memory overhead.
